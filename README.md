# Linear-Interpolation
#The purpose of the program will predict where the ISS is above earth at any given time through linear interpolation.
#Part 1 of the linear interpolation program will calculate the slope and y-intercept to result in the formula for p (ISS distance from Houston). 
#This formula can be used to find the value of p at any given time (t).
#Part 2 of the linear interpolation program will determine the value of t at 300 minutes which is the distance from Houston.
#I used the linear equation from part one.
